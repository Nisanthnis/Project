# Developed a Python-based website vulnerability scanner that discovers URLs from a 
given website and checks for common security vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site 
Scripting (XSS), and insecure server configurations. The tool performs automated scans, 
identifies vulnerabilities, and logs potential security risks, assisting in the detection of exploitable 
flaws in web applications.
